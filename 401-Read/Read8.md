## List Comprehensions in Python
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.

If you used to do it like this:
```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```
You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension. Notice the append method has vanished!
```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```
## Syntax
The list comprehension starts with a ‘[‘ and ‘]’, square brackets, to help you remember that the result is going to be a list.

The basic syntax uses square brackets.
```
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
```
This is equivalent to:
````
for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression
```
> **_Note:_**let us explore what is happen with this shortcut code:
```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```
1. ***new_list*** The new list (result).

2. ***expression(i)*** Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list.

2. ***for i in old_list*** The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the old list.

3. ***if filter(i)*** Apply a filter with an If-statement.

This blog shows an example of how to visually break down the list comprehension:

list comprehensions, how you can use it:

* Create a list using loops and list comprehension
* Multiplying parts of a list
* Show the first letter of each word
* Lower/Upper case converter
* Print numbers only from a given string
* Parsing a file using list comprehension
* Using list comprehension in functions
